            <h3>Cervical Cancer</h3>
            <p>
              In 2022, 1450 women in Canada were diagnosed with cervical cancer.
              Cervical cancer is mainly caused by certain types of HPV. It is
              transmitted through sexual activity. Pap tests are done to
              visualize the cervix and obtain a sample to undergo analysis.
              Results from this test can be normal or can show varying degrees
              of abnormality. Based on the result, management can include
              repeating the pap test, doing an HPV test or procedures to remove
              the abnormal tissue. Detection can lead to early treatment, which
              has the ability to prevent cervical cancer from developing.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is recommended to undergo a pap test between ages 21-65 every
              2-3 years. This can be delayed if not yet sexually active at age
              21. Screening can be stopped at age 65 if the last 3 consecutive
              pap tests have been negative.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pap tests may be uncomfortable however they should not be painful.
              In order to prepare yourself, avoid going when you have your
              period as this may lead to inaccurate results. In the 48 hours
              before the test, do not have sex or insert any products in your
              vagina. In Canada, it is recommended to get the HPV Vaccine
              (Gardasil) in order to help prevent infection by certain strains
              of HPV.

              People who smoke are twice as likely to develop cervical cancer
              than those who donâ€™t smoke. Speak to your health care professional
              about smoking cessation or visit **HERE - hyperlink* on our page
              for resources to help you quit.

            <h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
            <p>
              Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. 1 in 8 women in
              Canada are estimated to be diagnosed in their lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
              The screening test for breast cancer is a mammogram, which is an
              X-Ray photo of the breast. These images can detect early stages of
              breast cancer before any symptoms start. In general, it is
              recommended to undergo a mammogram between ages 50 to 74 every 2-3
              years. However, this may be different depending on your risk
              factors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speak to your health care provider if you are at higher risk for
              developing breast cancer. This includes: history of atypical
              breast biopsies, history of chest radiation or a genetic
              predisposition. Have a conversation with your healthcare provider
              if you would like to know more about the potential harms of
              screening for breast cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              To prepare yourself for your test, do not wear any products on
              your body including deodorant, perfume or powders. Fat tissue can
              increase the amount of estrogen circulating in your body, which
              has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
              Keeping a healthy weight and being physically active can help
              reduce your risk. Limiting alcohol consumption can also help
              reduce your risk.

            <h3>Colorectal Cancer</h3>
            <p>
              Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of death from cancer. The
              rates of new cases are declining partly due to an increase in
              screening. Screening can identify precancerous lesions and when
              removed can reduce progression to cancer. Most people with
              colorectal cancer have no family history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The FIT test is a stool test that checks for the presence of blood
              in stool. Alternatively, you may undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy.
              Similar to a colonoscopy, this is a procedure where a camera is
              inserted through the rectum to view the colon and rectum.
            </p>
            <p>
              People aged 50-74 can either undergo a FIT test every 2 years or a
              sigmoidoscopy every 10 years. If you have other risk factors or
              family members with a history of colorectal cancer diagnosed at a
              certain age, screening may need to begin earlier and be done more
              frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the FIT test, you will need to collect a small sample of your
              stool using a collection kit. Once you have collected the sample,
              you will need to return it to the testing centre.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the sigmoidoscopy, your healthcare provider will prescribe
              laxatives that you will need to start taking the day prior which
              will help empty out your bowels in preparation for the test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colorectal cancer has been linked to increased alcohol
              consumption, obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity. It is
              recommended to consume a healthy diet with whole grains, fruits,
              vegetables and limit the amount of red and processed meats. *

              Most people with lung cancer will not have symptoms for the first

              Currently, there are no official screening recommendations for
              lung cancer in Quebec. However, in 2021, Quebec initiated a lung
              cancer screening demonstration project. It offers a low dose CT
              for people at high risk for developing lung cancer. This includes:
              people between the ages of 55-74 who have either smoked on or off
              for at least 20 years or smoked on or off for at least 20 years
              and quit less than 15 years ago.
